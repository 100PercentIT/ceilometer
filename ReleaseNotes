Ceilometer v0.1 (Folsom) Release Notes
======================================

This is the first release of ceilometer.  Please take all appropriate caution
in using it, as it is a technology preview at this time.

It is curently tested to work with OpenStack 2012.2 Folsom. Due to its use of
openstack-common, and the modification that were made in term of notification 
to many other components (glance, cinder, quantum), it will not easily work 
with any prior version of OpenStack.

Currently covered components are: Nova, Nova-network, Glance, Cinder and 
Quantum.  Notably, there is no support yet for Swift and it was decided not
to support nova-volume in favor of Cinder. A detailed list of meters covered
per component can be found at:
  xxxx

The only tested and complete database backend is currently MongoDB, the 
SQLAlchemy one is still work in progress.

The current best source of information on how to deploy this project is found
as the devstack implementation but feel free to come to #openstack-metering on
freenode for more info.

Please note that metering can generate lots of data very quickly. Have a look
at the following spreadsheet to evaluate what you will end up with.
